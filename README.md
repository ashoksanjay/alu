# alu

4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog, featuring core functionalities like:
✔️ Addition and Subtraction
✔️ Logical Operations (AND, OR, XOR)
✔️ Bitwise Shifting (Logical Left/Right)
✔️ Comparison (Equality Check)

Key Highlights:
🔧 Designed using Verilog and simulated on [Simulation Tool/Software Used, e.g., ModelSim, Quartus Prime].
📊 Verified functionality with output waveforms, ensuring proper behavior for all selected operations.
🔍 Generated RTL schematics to visualize the design hierarchy and internal connections.
✅ Completed post-mapping and post-fitting to validate real-world implementation readiness.

Output Features:
Result: A 5-bit output supporting overflow and carry detection.
Flags: Implemented Zero, Carry, and Negative indicators for enhanced functionality.
Fully combinational design optimized for synthesis.
